## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-06

First release. The skill is a port: it was written and used inside Cursor
against a production multi-agent system, and this repository is where it
becomes installable, versioned and checked.

### Added

- **`agent-orchestrator` skill** (618 lines) — the orchestrator pattern with a
  shared context object and a sub-agent protocol; a tool-calling loop with
  in-loop trimming, wrap-up injection at ~70% of the window and a max-iteration
  guard that still composes a partial answer; meta-tools that delegate rather
  than execute; sub-agent retry split into retryable and fatal; a multi-stage
  pipeline with complexity detection, human-in-the-loop checkpoints and resume;
  multi-provider routing with fallback, exponential backoff and health checks;
  a four-layer memory system (chat history, working memory, long-term learnings,
  insights) with confidence lifecycles, fuzzy dedup, conflict resolution and
  decay; context budget allocation; self-learning feedback loops.
- **`references/patterns.md`** (351 lines) — the data models and algorithms
  behind the above: message and result protocols, pipeline models, the SQL
  validation loop, context-window sizes and token estimation, learning
  extraction heuristics, confidence management, the fuzzy-dedup and
  conflict-resolution patterns, cross-resource transfer, and a suggestion engine
  that costs no LLM calls.
- **`references/llm-proxy-billing.md`** (255 lines) — the wallet side of
  reselling LLM access, generalized from an OpenRouter Management API
  integration: tiered balances and the single boundary where markup applies,
  two-phase commit against a provider API with compensating transactions,
  transaction-scoped advisory locking, optimistic concurrency for reclaims,
  spend-delta polling and the three cases it must distinguish, budget/loop/
  auto-pause guardrails converging on one pause function with per-cause
  timestamps, per-tenant key lifecycle and healing, the refund waterfall, and
  model routing precedence.
- Structural validator (`test/validate.py`) enforcing one version across four
  files, Agent Skills front-matter limits, and reference links in **both**
  directions — the source this skill came from shipped a `reference.md` that
  nothing referenced, and that is now a failing check.
- Installer CLI, `install.sh`, Cursor rule channel, plugin + marketplace
  manifests, CI with negative self-tests.

### Notes

The `references/patterns.md` file was `reference.md` in the source and was
renamed on the way in: it is loaded by name from `SKILL.md`, and the validator
now requires that link to resolve.
